# just-the-docs-template

This is an officially-supported, *bare-minimum* template to deploy the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme to GitHub Pages. More specifically, it:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem (pinned to the latest stable)
- uses the new [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-github-pages-custom-github-actions-workflows-beta/) to deploy to pages

Other than that, you're free to customize this template however you'd like! [Browse our documentation](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) to learn more about how to use the theme.

To get started:

- Click the "[use this template](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/generate)" button.
- In your newly created repo, go to the `Settings` tab -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment` -> `Source`: `GitHub Actions`.
  - If there were any failed Actions, go to the `Actions` tab and click on `Re-run jobs`.
